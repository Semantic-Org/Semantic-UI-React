The [official][8] integration between [Semantic UI][5] and [React][3].

>Hey, we're in development. There are [big changes](#how-can-i-help) taking place while we [migrate to SUI-Org][12]. Minor versions may introduce **breaking changes until the [v1.0][6] release**.

## Install

    npm i stardust -S

## Usage

**App.js**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Button } from 'stardust'

export default class TryStardust extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Button>Hello</Button>
  }
}
```

**index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Try Stardust</title>

  <!-- SUI CSS -->
  <link href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.1.8/semantic.css" rel="stylesheet">

  <!-- Temporary script dependencies until we're done removing jQuery -->
  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.1.8/semantic.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

We then use [Webpack][13] to create `bundle.js` from `App.js` and include it in `index.html`.

For more complete examples, check out the [Doc Site][2].

## Debugger

We use the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module for debugging.  You can turn debugging on and off via the `localStorage.debug` flag from the browser console.  See the [debug docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more.

```js
localStorage.debug = 'stardust:*'         // default, debug all components
localStorage.debug = 'stardust:dropdown'  // debug only the dropdown
localStorage.debug = null                 // turn debug off
```

Once you change the flag, you need to refresh your browser to see the changes in debug output.

## How Can I Help?

First, get setup and acquainted with development by reading the [contributing guidelines][1].

### v1.0 Migrations

We're making two migrations right now:

1. [Moving legacy component APIs to our v1 API][15]
1. [Removing jQuery and SUI JS][11]

Each of these issues includes a list of components and more information on how you can help.

### New Components

There is an [issue][14] for every missing component.  They are all labeled `enhancement` `help wanted` and we're accepting PRs for these.

Be sure to check out the above migrations before embarking on a new component.  All new components should be written in accordance with the migrations above.

## Our Principles

[TechnologyAdvice][9] has been [dogfooding][10] Stardust in production since fall of 2015.  This living list is updated as we iterate.  We'll lock it in as our v1.0 constitution soon.

- No jQuery dependency
- No animation dependencies
- Reuse SUI CSS transitions
- Complete keyboard support
- Complete SUI component definition support
- Completely documented
- Completely tested
- Abstract away HTML markup intricacies
