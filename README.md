### Stardust

Stardust is a set of specifications and tools for building UI libraries.

#### Why?

There are a number of packages that a UI library needs to create great UI components. Take a look at SUIR's [`/src/lib`][201] as an example. This core library enables the SUIR features we love today such as shorthand props, event stack handling, auto controlled state, controlling the rendered component, and more.

Other libraries in the wild have some of these features and some of their own. It is our desire that the community share the best UI component practices in a core library to the greater benefit of the web.

A shared library means more great ideas and more engineering support for features and bug fixes. More importantly, it means more consistency in UI components on the web. We're really excited to see just how far we can take this aspect of collaboration.

#### Scope

You can think of Stardust as the internals of a good component library.  This encompasses everything except for the actual UI components themselves.

We are currently discussing which, if any, components will be included.  The collaborative result of our specifications will determine Stardust's final scope. 

#### Specifications

All our specifications are open for collaboration.  You are also welcome to post your own proposals here.

Stardust's specifications are posted to [`/specifications`][8].  We review and discuss specifications via PRs.

It is our desire that the patterns and utils around modern component libraries are not proprietary but the result of collaboration and shared sentiment among library developers and consumers.
