            Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from
            pet shops, private owners, or shelters.

          <p>
            A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog
            from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and
            upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly,
            finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who
            may not find one so readily.
