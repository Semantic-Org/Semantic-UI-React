This is a reference for upgrading your application to v2 of Semantic UI React. While there's a lot covered here, you probably won't need to do everything for your app.

## Upgrade of `react-popper` for `Popup`

_Popper.js v1 is out of date, v2 was released in Dec 2019, time to upgrade 🚀_

### `offset` can't be specified as string anymore

Previously it was possible to pass different units to the offset prop as units. This behavior was changed and `offset` accepts a tuple or a function. Examples in our docs were also updated.

```diff
 <>
-  <Popup offset="50px" />
+  <Popup offset={[50, 0]} />
   <br />
-  <Popup offset="-100%p" />
+  <Popup offset={({ popper }) => [-popper.width, 0]} />
 </>
```

### `popperModifiers` should be defined as array now

The `popperModifiers` prop should be defined as an array with changed format (see [Popper docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/#10-update-modifiers)).

```diff
-<Popup popperModifiers={{ preventOverflow: { padding: 0 } }} />
+<Popup popperModifiers={[{ name: 'preventOverflow', options: { padding: 0 } }]} />
```

### a wrapping element around `Popup`

We started to use an additional wrapping element around `Popup` for positioning, see [Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React#3947](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/pull/3947) for more details. To pass props to this element `popper` shorthand can be used, see [an example](/modules/popup/#usage-position-fixed).

⚠️We also made a fix in [Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React#4094](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/pull/4094) to transfer `zIndex` value to avoid any breaks.

## `Responsive` component was removed

`Responsive` component was deprecated in 1.1.0. There are two main reasons for the removal: there is no connection between breakpoints and pure SSR (server side rendering) support.

[@artsy/fresnel](https://github.com/artsy/fresnel) was proposed as a replacement as it properly handles SSR scenarios.

```diff
+import { createMedia } from "@artsy/fresnel";
import React from "react";
-import { Responsive, Segment } from "semantic-ui-react";
+import { Segment } from "semantic-ui-react";

+const AppMedia = createMedia({
+  breakpoints: {
+    mobile: 320,
+    tablet: 768,
+    computer: 992,
+    largeScreen: 1200,
+    widescreen: 1920
+  }
+});
+const mediaStyles = AppMedia.createMediaStyle();
+const { Media, MediaContextProvider } = AppMedia;

-const App = () => (
-  <Responsive as={Segment} {...Responsive.onlyMobile}>
-    Mobile
-  </Responsive>
-)
+const App = () => (
+  <>
+    <style>{mediaStyles}</style>
+    <MediaContextProvider>
+      <Segment as={Media} at="mobile">
+        Mobile
+      </Segment>
+    </MediaContextProvider>
+  </>
+);
```

The full migration guide is available in [Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React#4008](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/pull/4008), it contains more detailed explanation and examples for Next.js & Gatsby.

## `MountNode` component was removed

`MountNode` component was deprecated in 1.1.0. The main reason for the removal is that the component should not be a part of the public API as it solves our specific issue with the `Modal` component.
Additional details are available in [Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React#4027](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/pull/4027).
