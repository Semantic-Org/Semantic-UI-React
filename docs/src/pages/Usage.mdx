## Install

Semantic UI React provides React components while Semantic UI provides themes as CSS stylesheets.
Install the React components and choose a theme that suits your needs.

### Option 1: Package Manager

React components can be installed via <code>yarn</code> or <code>npm</code>:

```bash
yarn add semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
## Or NPM
npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
```

After install, **import the minified CSS file in your app's entry file:**

```js fitted label=index.js
import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css'
```

<Message info size='tiny' attached='bottom'>
  <Icon name='idea' />
  Themes from Semantic UI >=2.3.x require Semantic UI React >=0.81.0.
</Message>

<p>
  The <a href={semanticUICSSRepoURL}>Semantic UI CSS package</a> is automatically synced with the
  main Semantic UI repository to provide a lightweight CSS only version of Semantic UI.
</p>

If you are using TypeScript, you don't need to install anything, typings are included with the package.

### Option 2: CDN (no bundler)

This is the quickest way to get started, just add this link and script tag to the `<head>` of your `index.html` file.

```html fitted label=index.html
<link
  async
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@${props.versions.sui}/dist/semantic.min.css"
/>
<script
  async
  src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@${props.versions.sui}/dist/semantic.min.js"
></script>
```

## Custom themes

Detailed documentation on Semantic UI theming is provided in our [Theming guide](/theming).

## Supported Bundling Options

Semantic UI React is fully supported by all modern JavaScript bundlers.

### Create React App

Semantic UI React is fully compatible with `create-react-app` and works out the box. Setting up of custom theme is covered in [Theming guide](/theming).

### Webpack 4

Semantic UI React is fully supported by Webpack 4. Please ensure that you build your app in [production mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/) before release. Semantic UI React includes several optimizations in production mode, such as stripping `propTypes` from your build.
